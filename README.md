A [Next.js](https://nextjs.com) website that mainly involves generating content out of a bunch of markdown files contained in `notes/` and `posts/` which contain rough, unorganized yet useful information and thought-out articles respectively. It's still a work in progress as I have no clear direction I want to take this site toward. However, it is something that I will always keep in check; as I use this as a hub for whatever I work on, especially if it involves a lot of reading.
